# Joke Sender
This application sends you an SMS containing a random joke every 2 hours (only on weekdays and during business hours). The jokes were pulled from [r/ProgrammerDadJokes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerDadJokes/) and filtered down to the top 5,000 self-contained posts.

## Setup
1. Edit the `phoneNumber` [Application Global](https://app.losant.com/applications/~losant-application-jokeSender-0~/globals) with your phone number.
2. Enable the [Joke Sender](https://app.losant.com/applications/~losant-application-jokeSender-0~/workflows/~losant-flow-jokeSender-0~/develop) workflow.

## Configuration
You can change the time zone and hours to receive jokes by editing the [Time Range Node](https://docs.losant.com/workflows/logic/time-range/) in the [Joke Sender](https://app.losant.com/applications/~losant-application-jokeSender-0~/workflows/~losant-flow-jokeSender-0~/develop) workflow.

## The Jokes
The jokes are found in your [Application Files](https://app.losant.com/applications/~losant-application-jokeSender-0~/files) in the `jokes.json` file. That file was generated by a Node script that can be found in the [joke-sender](https://github.com/InconceivableDuck/joke-sender) GitHub repository.
